I asked ChatGTP what people think of Hugo and here is the conclusion it has written:
'Overall, Hugo has received positive feedback from developers and users in the web development community. 
Hugo is a popular choice for those looking for a fast, efficient, and customizable static site generator.
However, like any tool, it may not be the best fit for every project or developer.'.
